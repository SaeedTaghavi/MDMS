# MDMS: Molecular Dynamics Made Simple

Perform Molecular Dynamics Simulations from scratch within minutes. This program is an interface to one of the most popular MD codes (Amber), aiding users in preparing and running their own simulations.
Provided (or downloaded from within MDMS) PDB structure is  at first checked for anomalies (missing atoms, missing residues). Then, user chooses which ligands will be included in the system for MD simulations. 
The next steps are determining force field parameters for ligands, solvating the system, creating topology and initial coordinates files. Finally, user specifies options that will control MD and initialize simulations.


## Getting Started

Just run the program and follow on-screen prompts.


### Prerequisites

- any Linux distribution
- Ambertools installed


### Installing

Use git to clone the repository to your Linux machine:

git clone https://github.com/szymonzaczek/MDMS.git
